I graduated Oberlin College in May with a film major and a computer science minor and I spent the last 3 months at the Recurse Center.

I spent all my time at the Recurse Center working with Javascript. I'm excited by Javascript's potential as a full stack language and have written back end/full stack projects in addition to contributing front end code to opensource projects.

I have made a few [films and animations](https://vimeo.com/theilonabrand) and I'm very interested in the intersections of art and code. I like aesthetically pleasing code, and bringing sensibilities from cinema composition and theory into the way I think about user interfaces and experiences.
